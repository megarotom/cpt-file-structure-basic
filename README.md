# CPT File Structure

The best way to use GitHub is to have a `development` branch and a `master` branch. I highly recommend doing it the right way, but, it can get a bit confusing for n00bs, so, here is an alternative.

For your CPT, you will have two folders: `development` and `master`. In each folder, you will have diferent versions of your CPT.

## Development Folder
You will do all your coding in this folder. This will likely contain code and sketches that are incomplete or maybe even don't even work. That is OK. Every day, you should upload your `development` folder to your repository. The easiest way to do this it to drag it from your desktop to the repository on [Github.com](https://github.com).

## Master Folder
Once you have reached a milestone (e.g., `Add gravity to all objects`), and your game works, then you can *copy* the working code from the `development` folder to the `master` folder, then drag the whole `master` folder from your desktop to your CPT repository. Keep in here *only* the files necessary for your game to run.

## Workflow
1. Download zip
2. Make changes to the `development` files.
3. When you reach a milestone (*and the progtram works*), replace the code in the `master` folder with the new code.
4. Upload the `master` folder to your repository.
    - Be sure to give it a proper commit message.
5. Upload the `development` folder too.

Rather than dragging and dropping files and folders from your computer into Github, you can edit the files in GitHub and paste the code in.
