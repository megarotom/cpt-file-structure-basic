The best way to use GitHub is to have a `development` branch and a `master` branch. I highly recommend doing it the right way, but, it can get a bit confusing for n00bs, so, here is an alternative.

For your CPT, you will have two folders: `development` and `master`. In each folder, you will have diferent versions of your CPT.

## Development Folder
You will do all your coding in this folder. This will likely contain code and sketches that are incomplete or maybe even don't even work. That is OK. Every day, you should upload your `development` folder to your repository. The easiest way to do this it to drag it from your desktop to the repository on [Github.com](https://github.com).

## Master Folder
Once you have reached a milestone (e.g., `Add gravity to all objects`), and your game works, then you can **copy** the working code to the `master` folder, then drag the whole `master` folder from your desktop to your CPT repository. Keep in here *only* the files necessary for your game to run.
